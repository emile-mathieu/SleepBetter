# Sleep Better

SleepBetter is a fun and simple iOS app designed to help you find the optimal time to go to bed based on your daily habits. By inputting specific criteria, such as your wake-up time and coffee consumption, the app uses a CoreML model trained on mock data to recommend the best time for you to go to bed.

# Features
